# Qwiic-Adaptive-Switch

Qwiic-Adaptive-Switch modules provide an easy way to create your own adaptive switch input or output boxes through Qwiic or STEMMA QT ecosystem. Qwiic Adaptive Switch modules can be connected to any Qwiic enabled board to create an adaptive switch box.

You can find more information about <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic">Qwiic Connect System</a> at SparkFun official website.

Qwiic-Adaptive-Switch modules use Qwiic/JST-SH-4Pin connector and IC2 interface to communicate with main microcontroller which means you can connect multiple switch modules by daisy chaining them. It's using TCA9534 bus expander.

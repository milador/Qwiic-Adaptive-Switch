# Qwiic-Adaptive-Switch

The Qwiic-Adaptive-Switch module provides an easy way to create your own adaptive switch boxes through Qwiic or STEMMA QT ecosystem. The module can be connected to any Qwiic enabled board to create a nadaptive switch box.

You can find more information about <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic">Qwiic Connect System</a> at SparkFun official website.

This module is using Qwiic/JST-SH-4Pin connector and IC2 interface to communicate with main microcontroller which means you can connect multiple switch modules by daisy chaining them. It's using TCA9534 bus expander.
